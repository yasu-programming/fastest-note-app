# Feature Specification: Fast Online Synchronized Note-Taking App

**Feature Branch**: `001-web-notion`  
**Created**: 2025-09-07  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "最速で表示されるオンライン同期可能なメモアプリの作成。まずはwebアプリを作成して、将来的にスマホアプリなどにも展開したい。notionの表示が遅いため、このメモアプリ開発を試みる。ページ管理もすることができる、ディレクトリのようにメモを管理することができるアプリ"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Feature description parsed: Fast note-taking app with online sync and hierarchical organization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Actors: note-taking users
   → Actions: create notes, organize in hierarchy, sync across devices
   → Data: notes, folders/directories, user preferences
   → Constraints: must be faster than Notion, web-first with mobile expansion
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Authentication: email/password with standard security practices
   → Note limits: 1MB per note, 1000 notes per folder, 10-level folder depth
   → Offline functionality: local storage with sync on reconnection
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Primary user flow: create, organize, and sync notes quickly
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Requirements focused on speed, sync, and hierarchical organization
6. Identify Key Entities
   → Notes, Folders, User accounts
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements clarified with industry standards
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ❌ Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- 👥 Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user needs to quickly create and organize notes in a hierarchical structure (like directories) that synchronizes across all their devices. They want the experience to be significantly faster than existing solutions like Notion, with immediate response times for viewing and editing content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user opens the app, **When** they click to create a new note, **Then** the note editor should appear within 200ms and be ready for input
2. **Given** a user has created notes in a folder structure, **When** they access the same account from another device, **Then** all notes and folder organization should be immediately visible and accessible
3. **Given** a user is editing a note, **When** they make changes, **Then** changes should be saved and synchronized in real-time without user intervention
4. **Given** a user wants to organize content, **When** they create folders and move notes between them, **Then** the hierarchical structure should update instantly and persist across sessions

### Edge Cases
- **Network loss during editing**: System continues working offline, saves changes locally, and syncs automatically when connection restored
- **Simultaneous editing conflicts**: Last-write-wins conflict resolution with user notification of overwritten changes
- **Deep folder nesting**: Maximum 10-level folder depth with user warning at limit
- **Large content scenarios**: Notes limited to 1MB, folders limited to 1000 items, with pagination for large collections

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create text-based notes instantly with sub-200ms response time
- **FR-002**: System MUST enable users to organize notes in a hierarchical folder structure (directory-like system)
- **FR-003**: System MUST synchronize all notes and folder structures across multiple devices in real-time
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to create, rename, move, and delete both notes and folders
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist all user data and maintain folder hierarchy between sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide instant search functionality across all notes and folders
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to move notes between folders using drag-and-drop or similar intuitive methods
- **FR-008**: System MUST authenticate users via email/password with secure password requirements and session management
- **FR-009**: System MUST support offline editing with local storage and automatic sync when connection restored
- **FR-010**: System MUST limit notes to 1MB maximum size and folders to 1000 items maximum
- **FR-011**: System MUST resolve editing conflicts using last-write-wins strategy with user notification
- **FR-012**: System MUST retain user data indefinitely with regular automated backups
- **FR-013**: System MUST limit folder nesting to maximum 10 levels deep
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide pagination for folders containing more than 100 items
- **FR-015**: System MUST save changes locally during offline periods and batch sync on reconnection

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Note**: Text content with metadata (title, creation/modification dates, folder location)
- **Folder**: Organizational container that can hold notes and other folders, with hierarchical parent-child relationships
- **User Account**: Individual user identity with associated notes and folder structures, sync preferences
